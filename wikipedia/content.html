        <h1>Advantages of the internet for children</h1>

        <p>To give, or not to give your child access to the Internet isnt the question.

            Overall, the results reveal that parents may be cooler than kids think. For example, non-parents who took the poll where stricter when it comes to when and how they’d allow children to access online technologies—by an average age gap of two years, with 16 percent saying they would not allow children ages four to six to use a device such as gaming console without supervision. Compare that with 27 percent of the parents who say its okay. And when it comes to online services such as social networking, 19 percent of parents with kids age seven to 10 have given their kids the green light, compared to only eight percent of non-parents who would give them the go-ahead. Whats more, of parents with children under the age of seven who responded to the survey: Twenty-nine percent allow their children to use mobile phones unsupervised Forty percent allow their children to use a computer unsupervised Forty-one percent allow their children to use a gaming console unsupervised While some might dismiss the age question, the fact is the interactions children experience online and through gaming actually condition their interpersonal skills. Setting kids up for success early is important. There is no magic age, but rather, parents should take into consideration the appropriateness for their individual family and responsibility or maturity level of their child.</p>
